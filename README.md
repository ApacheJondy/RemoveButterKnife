# RemoveButterKnife

## What's the plugin
An Android Studio plugin to help remove use of ButterKnife

## Why i do this
ButterKnife is a wellknow open source tool to help you inject your view,  but some times, you use plugin to gen butterknife's code, but you
don't want to use it again. 

It's a very horrible job to delete every line inject code and write findviewbyid code, so, i made this plugin to do it.

## How to use it
(You can search it on your AS plugin install page, name is RemoveButterKnife)
1.Clone the code and build it in your  idea

2.Then, you can find a jar, install it as a plugin in your AndroidStudio**(You also can find the jar in the project)**

3.Open your Activity/Fragment you want to change.

4.Find the RemoveButterKnife button in your android studio edit menu
